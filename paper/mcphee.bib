	abstract =     "Push is a programming language designed for the
	expression of evolving programs within an evolutionary
	computation system. This article describes Push and
	illustrates some of the opportunities that it presents
	for evolutionary computation. Two evolutionary
	computation systems, PushGP and Pushpop, are described
	in detail. PushGP is a genetic programming system that
	evolves Push programs to solve computational problems.
	Pushpop, an ?autoconstructive evolution? system, also
	evolves Push programs but does so while simultaneously
	evolving its own evolutionary mechanisms.",

	its transparent support for the expression and

	enhances this feature by permitting explicit
