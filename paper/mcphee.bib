	expression of evolving programs within an evolutionary
	computation system. This article describes Push and
	illustrates some of the opportunities that it presents
	for evolutionary computation. Two evolutionary
	computation systems, PushGP and Pushpop, are described
	in detail. PushGP is a genetic programming system that
	evolves Push programs to solve computational problems.
	Pushpop, an ?autoconstructive evolution? system, also
	evolves Push programs but does so while simultaneously
	evolving its own evolutionary mechanisms.",

	abstract =	"Several genetic programming researchers have argued
	for the utility of genetic operators that act
	uniformly. By act uniformly we mean two specific
	things: that the probability of an inherited program
	component being modified during inheritance is
	independent of the size and shape of the parent
	programs beyond the component in question; and that
	pairs of parents are combined in ways that allow
	arbitrary combinations of components from each parent
	to appear in the child. Uniform operators described in
	previous work have had limited utility, however,
	because of a mismatch between the relevant notions of
	uniformity and the hierarchical structure and variable
	sizes of many genetic programming representations. In
	this chapter we describe a new genetic operator, ULTRA,
	which incorporates aspects of both mutation and
	crossover and acts approximately uniformly across
	programs of variable sizes and structures. ULTRA treats
	hierarchical programs as linear sequences and includes
	a repair step to ensure that syntax constraints are
	satisfied after variation. We show that on the drug
	bioavailability and Pagie-1 benchmark problems ULTRA
	produces significant improvements both in
	problem-solving power and in program size relative to
	standard operators. Experiments with factorial
	regression and with the Boolean 6-multiplexer problem
	demonstrate that ULTRA can manipulate programs that
	make use of hierarchical structure, but also that it is
	not always beneficial. The demonstrations evolve
	programs in the Push programming language, which makes
	repair particularly simple, but versions of the
	technique should be applicable in other genetic
	programming systems as well.",

  abstract =	"Genetic programming systems often produce programs
		 that include unnecessary code. This is undesirable for
		 several reasons, including the burdens that
		 overly-large programs put on end-users for program
		 interpretation and maintenance. The problem is
		 exacerbated by recently developed techniques, such as
		 genetic programming with geometric semantic crossover,
		 that tend to produce enormous programs. Methods for
		 automatically simplifying evolved programs are
		 therefore of interest, but automatic simplification is
		 non-trivial in the context of traditional program
		 representations with unconstrained function sets. Here
		 we show how evolved programs expressed in the
		 stack-based Push programming language can be
		 automatically and reliably simplified using a simple,
		 stochastic hill-climber. We demonstrate and
		 quantitatively characterise this simplification process
		 on programs evolved to solve four non-trivial genetic
		 programming problems with qualitatively different
		 function sets.",
