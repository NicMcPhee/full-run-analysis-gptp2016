# Analysis of full filtered ancestry tree for a short successful PushGP run

My plan for this is to demonstrate the use of graph DBs to at least document (if not "fully" understand) 
all the key events in a short successful run on replace space with newline.

We started with the filtered graph from this run, and identified about 40 individuals that seem to be 
critical in the run. Going through those and looking at how their genomes, programs, and error vectors 
differ from generation to generation, it's clear that the filtering is a little aggressive in a few 
places and we'll probably need to introduce some additional individuals, but it does look like we 
have most of it.
