Individual 5_485 a result of alternation with uniform-mutation with 4_772 as a parent: Mitchell Finzel

Genome:
* There were two changes in genome
  -- exec_when -> 0 to integer_max -> 0 (line 64)
  -- exec_shove -> 0 to boolean_eq -> 0 (line 97)

Program:
* Lines 22-24, 27, 29 and 35 showed differences some attributable to the genome changes.
* In those lines there are a few omitted lines but on further inspection the ommitted lines appear to be caused by lines that combined from 4_772. i.e line 30 and 31 from the parent were combined as line 29 followed by a blank line in 5_485 with boolean_eq being swapped in for exec_shove.

Error-Vector:
* There appears to be a lot of test case differences

Error-Vectpr Even-Odd:
* There appears to be some corruption here but in the regular error-vector file it is evident that the test cases that changed were all odd test cases and as far as my eye can tell they all improved.
