Looking at individual 3_122 who was created by alternation with uniform-mutation of a double selection of individual 2_983: Mitchell Finzel

Genome:
* The genome appears to have 3 single line mutations though this behavior is caused by the double selection of 2_983 as a parent. (Perhaps mutations)
  -- stringcontainschar -> 1 to exec_while -> 1 (line 46)
  -- integer_shove -> 1 to char_empty -> 1 (line 60)
  -- string_emptystring -> 0 to string_yank -> 0 (line 130)
* The other difference is a five line deletion (lines 140 through 144 of 2_983)

Program:
* There are 2 single line changes and 2 three line changes.
* There are both removed lines and added lines in this individual

Error-Vector:
* There are differences across many of the test cases with signs of a pattern related to even-odd; more below.

Error-Vector Even-Odd:
* As suspected the test cases that differ were all even test cases. This is much like what was seen in the parent 2_983's differences with its parent and given the double selection of 2_983 to create 3_122 it appears that it has further changed in its printing cases.
* To my naked eye it appears that many of the test cases improved by a score of 1 resulting in the first 0 score print cases (2_983 had no perfect test print tests)
