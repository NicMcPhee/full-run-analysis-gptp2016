### programm diff

In the parent, there was a string of commands on line 20, a series of instructions on line 21 enclosed in a single
pair of parens, and then another series of commands on line 22. The last command on line 20 was `exec_when`

In the child, `exec_when` became `string_pop` on line 20. On line 21, the parens disappeared and all three lines appear as one.

### error vector diff

Exactly the same error vectors as the parent.
