## 16:106 Analysis

Child made through `alternation` method. There are two parents, but 15:801 was both of them.

### Genome Diff Analysis
There were only three areas of changes from the parent(s) to the child: line 37, lines 53-59, and line 180. At line 37, the child simply changed the genome once. The chunk of lines from 53-59 was an addition of lines to the genome. And line 180 was also just a simple change from `string_empty` to `string_first`.

### Program Diff Analysis
There were only three changes in the program files: line 12, line 20, and line 66. On line 12, the only bit that was changed was from `boolean_eq` to `string_replacefirstchar`. On line 20, the code went from: `char_rot integer_stackdepth integer_min char_yankdup char_eq char_empty tagged_349 exec_yank string_rot exec_dup ` to `char_eq char_empty integer_swap integer_rot integer_fromstring string_pop string_shove char_rot integer_stackdepth integer_min char_yankdup char_eq char_empty tagged_349 exec_yank string_rot exec_dup `. And on line 66, the only changed was from `string_empty` to `string_first`, just like in the genome analysis.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Odd test cases change throughout the entire files.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
As stated above, odd test cases were different throughout the entire file except for odd cases 11-23 excluding 13. Even test cases stayed the same.
