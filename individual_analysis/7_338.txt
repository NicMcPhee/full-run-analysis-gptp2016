Individual 7_338 was created through the uniform-close-mutation of 6_612:Mitchell Finzel

Genome:
* 5 close mutations
  -- integer_fromchar -> 1 to integer_fromchar -> 0 (line 39)
  -- string_yank -> 0 to string_yank -> 1 (line 118)
  -- exec_do*count -> 1 to exec_do*count 0 (line 121)
  -- integer_mod -> 1 to integer_mod -> 0 (line 124)
  -- boolean_yank -> 0 to boolean_yank -> 1 (line 149)

Program:
* There are the additional close parens in lines 41-43 and 46-47

Error-Vector:
* Many test case differences starting from line 2 all the way through

Error-Vector Even-Odd:
* All of the differences in test cases were to odd test cases and there was a mix of increases and decreases in score.
