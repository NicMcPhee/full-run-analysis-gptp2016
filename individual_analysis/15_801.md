# 15:801

This individual was the result of alternation followed by a round of mutation, with parents 14:704 and 14:213. THere were fairly large distances to both parents (159 and 87 respectively).

## Diffing the genomes

15:801 is essentially constructed of two big blocks, the first from 14:704 and the second from 14:213.

15:801 appears to start by skipping over the first 8 lines (genes) of 14:213 and then picking up one instruction (line 9). It then swapped over to line 2 of 14:704 and picked up a large block (lines 2-61 of both 15:801 and 14:704). **There is presumably a mutation in this block.** Line 16 of 15:801 is `string_empty` where that line in 14:704 is `string_last`. That almost certainly isn't coming from 14:213 in a one instruction chunk, as there doesn't appear to be a copy of that instruction in 14:213 in the right vicinity (there's only one copy in the whole program, and it's down near the end).

Most of the rest of the program appears to come from the other parent (14:213). Lines 62-184 in 15:801 match lines 44-166 in 14:213 exactly. There are chunks (lines 80-88, 118-119, 156-170 - all in 15:801) that match (or very nearly match) in all three, and presumably represent some common ancestry for 14:213 and 14:704.

## Diffing the programs

The program diff appears to reflect the genome diff in that the start of 15:801's program mostly comes from 14:704, and the rest comes from 14:213.

There is again the weird first instruction (`boolean_and`) that appears to come from a few instructions down into 14:213, and then the rest of lines 2-20 of 15:801 all match lines 2-20 of 14:704. After that we switch to 14:213 from there to the end, with lines 21-81 of 15:801 matching 19-79 of 14:213 (with those being the last lines of both programs).

There only appear to be two shared chunks of program between the two parents, which is interesting given the number of shared genome chunks: Lines 51-56 and 65-66 in 15:801.

## Diffing the error vectors

This is _really_ interesting. Both the parents were pretty good, with 14:213 having single digit errors in all but three cases (170, 174, and 76), and quite a lot of zeros, especially in the odd test cases, where it was _nearly_ perfect. 14:704 was had an error of 1 on _all_ the even test cases. It was pretty strong (single digits) on the first half of the odd test cases, but was double digits on almost all the odd test cases from 105 to 199.

The child clearly combined their behaviors in an interesting way. It was _perfect_ on all the even test cases, presumably bringing in something from 14:213 that fixed the "off by one" error in 14:704. It also did very well on the odd test cases; it was single digits throughout - definitely better than 14:704 but lots of non-zero values so worse than 14:213.

We *definitely* want to look at the simplified programs for these three individuals and see what happened at that level.
