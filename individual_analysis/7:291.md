## 7:291 Analysis

Child made through `alternation-uniform-mutation`. Parents are 6:293 and 6:774.

### Genome Diff Analysis
The child took bits and pieces from both parents. Around lines 34-86, the child took many pieces from parent 6:293 that were not in parent 6:774. Lines 113-143 of parent 6:774 were completely taken out for the child's genome. The only bits that the child took of parent 6:774 were lines 7-8, 13, and 134-153, while the other majority of lines were either in both parents originally or were taken from parent 6:293's file.
