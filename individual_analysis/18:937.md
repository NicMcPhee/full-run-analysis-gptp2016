## 18:937 Analysis

This child is a result of an `alternation-uniform-mutation` method. Both parents are 17:189.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Two lines were removed from the parent's genome when making the child: `exex_yank` and `string_rot`. These took place at line 102 and 103 in the parent.

### Program Diff Analysis
Only one line was changed (probably during the mutation step), which was line 33. It went from `exec_yank string_rot boolean_pop exec_when` in the parent to `boolean_pop exec_when` in the child (AKA it only removed the `exec_yank string_rot` part, which is consistent with the genome analysis).

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Only five test cases differed: cases 7, 13, 25, 35 and 171. All of these test cases had a result of 2 on the parent, and they all dropped to 1 on the child.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
Same results as above error vector analysis.
