# 14:704

This was the result of a uniform mutation from 13:580 with a distance of 3, so we're not expecting much change here.

## Diffing the genomes

Not surprisingly, there are exactly three mutations:

* `char_rot` to `\space` on line 9
* `integer_rot` to `integer_fromboolean` on line 27
* `integer_pop` to `integer_gt` on line 45

## Diffing the programs

There were also the expected changes in the program, with the same changes made on lines 4, 11, and 20 of the programs.

## Diffing the error vectors

Somewhat surprisingly, these three little changes did have a very substantial impact on the even test errors. The odd test errors are identical from parent to child, but almost all the even errors are different, and generally for the better. The child (14:704) has an error of 1 for _every_ even test case (a problem fixed in the construction of 15:801 in the next generation), where the parent errors on the even test cases vary quite a bit (some zeros, lots of single digits, and a few between 10 and 20).
