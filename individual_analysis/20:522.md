## 20:522 Analysis

This child is a result of an `alternation-uniform-mutation` method. Both parents are 19:554.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Only one line, line 13 in the parent, was completely removed in the child.

### Program Diff Analysis
Showing something similar to the genome analysis, at line 7, part of the parent `string_butlast`, is completely gone in the child.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Three test cases, 3, 7, and 9, went from numerical value of 1 to 0 in the child.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
Same results as above. So essentially, the removal of the line `string_butlast` made the child improve in three places in odd test cases from the parent.
