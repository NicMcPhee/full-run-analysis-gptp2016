## Individual 20:424

This is one of the many individuals that descended from 19:554. It did so by way of `uniform-mutation`.

### genome diff

There were exactly three changes from the parent. 
- At line 47, `integer_fromstring 0` became `exec_dup 0`
- At line 77, `string_emptystring 0` became `string_eq 0`
- At line 149, `string_removechar 0` became `string_pop 0`

### program diff

The second two mutations simply replaced the instructions without changing the syntax at all. However, the first mutuation caused line 12 in the program to become three lines. `integer_fromstring` was in the middle of a long series of instructions. Replacing that instruction with `exec_dup` brought with it an open paren that was closed 6 instructions later by `char_yankdup`. 

### error vector diff

Since this is one of the solutions, the error vector is pretty boring. Test cases 3,7, and 9 went from changed from 1 to 0.
