Individual 6_612 a product of alternation with uniform mutation from 5_485 and a filtered out parent: Mitchell Finzel

Genome:
* There are 12 lines in the genome that changed and one 12 line section (lines 89 through 100 of 5_485) that were deleted.
* Some point mutations and uniform-close-mutations and probably alternation with the filtered out parent causing a large deletion.

Program:
* There are some pretty big and dense program changes here that im not going to try to type up.

Error-Vector:
* Starting at test case 73 there are many differences

Error-Vector Even-Odd:
* Only Odd test cases were different with a mix of increases and decreases in scores.
