## 6:293 Analysis

This child is a result of an `alternation` method. One of the parents is 5:910. The other isn't shown.

### Genome Diff Analysis
The child's file had lines added to them at lines 53-56, 60, and 67-91. Therefore, I'm assuming that these lines came from the other parent that isn't shown on the graph. EVery other lines stayed the same between the parent shown and the child.

### Program Diff Analysis
The child's program file had lines 5-7 added, as well as a little bit around lines 27-31 and lines 46-50. All other lines of the program file stayed the same as the parent in the child. Therefore, I'm assuming the changes came (again) from the parent not shown on the graph.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Almost all of the odd test cases changed from the parent file to the child file. 20 out of 100 odd test cases did _not_ change. The numbers paired with the test cases dropped significantly between the parent and the child.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
Similar results as the above analysis. All even test cases stayed the same.
