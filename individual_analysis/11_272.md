# 11:272

This was the result of a uniform mutation from 10:473 with a distance of 5, so we're not expecting big changes.

## Diffing the genomes

As expected, there were five mutations:

* `integer_swap` to `integer_rot` on line 27
* `string_containschar` to `char_rot` on line 53
* `exec_empty` to `char_yankdup` on line 56
* `string_parse_to_chars` to `exec_pop` on line 75
* `exec_yankdup` to `print_newline` on line 95

## Diffing the programs

This led to a fairly predictable set of changes, with the replacements made on lines 11, 21 (2nd and 3rd mutations), 24-25 (which includes a new open paren due to `exec_pop`), and 29. There's also a new close paren on line 27 that is (I think) being made available because of the introduction of `exec_pop` a few lines earlier.

## Diffing the error vectors

These changes had a significant impact on the error vectors, substantially improving performance on the even test cases. There were 21 even test cases where these mutations changed the error from 1 to 0, while no other even test cases changed in either direction. This includes lots of single digit errors (including other ones) and some pretty big errors (between 10 and 20) that didn't budge.

The odd test cases all remained unchanged _except_ for test case 1 that, weirdly, went from 0 to 2, i.e., got slightly worse.
