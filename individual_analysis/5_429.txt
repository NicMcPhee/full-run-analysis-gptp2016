Individual 5_429 a product of alternation with uniform-mutation from 4_256 and a filtered out parent: Mitchell Finzel

Genome:
* There are 9 lines that have been changed and 8 lines that were deleted.
* There was one large block from lines 34 to 39 that appeaqr to be alternation from the filtered out parent.
* A few of the changes seem to be from point mutation.
  -- string_yank -> 0 to string_rot -> 0 (line 7)
  -- integer_eq -> 0 to string_stackdepth -> 0 (line 8)
  -- exec_noop -> 0 to string_replacefirst -> 0 (line 13)
  -- exec_empty -> 0 to inl -> 0 (line 105)

Program:
* Changes in 4 lines where the genome swaps were performed.

Error-Vector:
* Many test results differences

Error-Vector Even-Odd:
* All affected cases were odd with many increasing in score and many decreqsing in score.
