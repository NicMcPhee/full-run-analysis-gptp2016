## Individual 8:538

Individual descended from 7:291 via `alternation`, with the other parent being filtered from the graph.

### genome diff

We don't see any changes until line 131. Instructions 131-134 in 8:538 were not inherited from 7:291, and takes the place of 3 lines in 7:291. There are two more changes before line 144. Line 144 is interesting because only the close count changed. It is possibile that _all_ of the lines after 131 actually come from the unknown parent. If so, the reason that some of the lines are similar would be that the two parents share a common ancestor.

### program diff

This is a short program, with the few differences from the parent at toward the end of the file. Line 48 in 7:291 becomes 3 lines in 8:538 because `boolean_invert_second_then_and` (which was not from 7:291) gains parens around it. The change in close count on the line 144 of the genome ended up not changing anything in the program. 

### error vector diff

The error vectors for all the even test cases were the same as the parent's. For the odd cases, both parent and child have error vectors in the single digits except for Test 171 which goes from 14 in 7:291 to 17 in 8:538. Every single one of the odd test cases changes by `+/-1` _or_ `+/-3`.
