## 14:213 Analysis

This child is a result of an `alternation-uniform-mutation` method. One of the parents is 13:575, and the other is 13:136.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Here I believe that the child took the first few lines (maybe lines 1-15) from 13:136. Then it took around line 16 from 13:575, and then it took lines 17-37 from 13:136. Then it took lines 38-118 from 13:575, and then finally finishing up by taking lines 120-end from parent 13:136. Therefore, it probably took a little bit more from 13:136 than from 13:575. It's clear that a couple mutations occurred, especially on line 119, where the line `boolean_swap` was added.

### Program Diff Analysis
A similar sort of pattern emerges with this program diff comparison. The first couple lines, however, look like they were taken from 13:136. Then around line 9-15 have some pieces taken from 13:136, except there are some parts of the parent that are cut out of the child. Lines 19-39 in the child stays similar to both parents. At line 40-46 of child, we take some lines from 13:575. We take a little bit more from 13:136 (lines 48-60 of the child), and then we take the remainder of the file from 13:575. Again, it looks like there was an easily visible mutation involving the `boolean_swap`, and can be seen on line 47 of the child.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
One test case, test case 7, matched between the child and 13:575. Test cases 11, 15, 23, 27, 33, 37, 63, and 77 all matched between child and 13:136. All other test cases remainded the same.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
The same findings as above, just written in a little bit more concise manner. No even test cases changed.
