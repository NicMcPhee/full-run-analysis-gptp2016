## 19:554 Analysis

Child made through `alternation` method. One parent is 18:937, the other one isn't shown on the graph.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Line 61 changed between the parent and the child; it went from `exec_rot` to `string_removechar`. Lines 152-195 in the child were almost completely changed from the parent. This suggests that this bit came from the other parent who isn't shown on the graph. I don't know if I would call this significant, but it is something to note.

### Program Diff Analysis
Similar to the genome analysis, line 13 changed from `(boolean_eq exec_rot (exec_s` to `(boolean_eq string_removechar exec_s` (I'm not sure where those parentheses finish up). At the lower end (lines 44-57 on the child), things changed drastically. Some bits were added to the child from (presumably) the other parent, and then some chunks were taken away from the parent present in the graph.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Only the odd test cases 1, 3, 9, 13, 25, 35, and 171 were changed. All other test cases remained the same.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Analysis
Same results as above.
