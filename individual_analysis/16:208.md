## 16:208 Analysis

This child is a result of an `alternation` method. Both parents are 15:801.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Only two lines, line 161 and line 183 were changed. On line 161, `string_yankdup` became `string_stackdepth`, and on line 183, `string_butlast` became `boolean-xor`.

### Program Diff Analysis
Just like above only two lines were changed: lines 58 and 73. Here, it's clear the only changes were the same words as above, as if just those little bits were mutated.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
Approximately 24 out of the 200 test cases changed. All of them were odd test cases. All of the changes in results to these cases only went up or down by 1.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
Same results as above. No even cases were changed at all.
