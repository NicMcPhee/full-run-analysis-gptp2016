## 5:910 Analysis

Child made through the `uniform-mutation` method. Parent is 4:107.

### Genome Diff Analysis
Only two lines were changed between the child and the parent: line 47 and line 71. All of the other lines were the same between the two files. On line 47, the change was from `integer_dec` to `integer_add`. Because the child was made through a simple mutation, it only has one child and therefore not many changes occurred.

### Program Diff Analysis
Only a few lines were changed: line 24 and 25 in the child, lines 26-36, and then a couple lines in the beginning (line 12) and one in the end (lines 37/38). The change from line 12 was a change from `integer_dec` to `integer_inc`. This makes sense if we look at the genome differences above as well. No other changes were that significantly obvious, again because of the child was made through the `uniform-mutation` method.

### Error Vector Diff Analysis
About every other line was changed between the child and the parent. All of the error numbers in the child's file were significantly lower than the numbers in the parent's file.

### Error Vector Even/Odd Diff Analysis
From lines 101-200, all of the test cases had different results. The results from the child's were significantly lower numbers than the numbers from the parent's result file.
